#Tests that the visibility of students/teachers enrolled in a course adheres to the FERPA controls and the
#Student usage controls available at the block and admin level.
#
#A set of 25 scenarios generated by `generateFerpaSteps.php`. These scenarios cover a minimal set of 
#the possible configurations for quickmail. Given 2 administrative settings with 3 options each, and 2 block-level
#settings with 2 and 3 options each, there are a total of 3*3*3*2=54 configuration combinations.
#Because settings at the administrative level override those at the block level, 29 of those can be removed,
#leaving the 25 given in the test.
#
#NB: Because of the additional complexity, the ferpa.feature test does not account for the groups filter.
Feature: Verify Ferpa controls WRT groups
